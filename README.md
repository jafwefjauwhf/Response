Hello xsticcy.
Well, it's been a couple minutes since we spoke huh?
I just wanna say, I'm sorry.
This is truely heartfelt as I didn't know they copyrighted it. I wanna say sorry to everyone involved in this situation as I wanna say I'm sorry aswell. I didn't want to create drama, and I was acting ruthless and unfun. I am sorry. I just wanna say, your plugin is very useful, but I'm just sorry this happened. Please.

Thank you
